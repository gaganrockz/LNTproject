Aim:
Design an advanced alert system utilizing motion detection and surveillance
infrastructure to promptly notify users of detected movement, ensuring rapid
response in industrial or residential settings


Problem description:
Traditional surveillance systems may lack real-time notification and
automation, leading to delays in responding to possible security breaches. The
challenge is to integrate motion detection with instant alert mechanisms using
tools like Cisco Packet tracer, enabling automated alarms and user
notifications when motion is detected in sensitive areas

Required Components
1. Cisco Packet Tracer (IDE/software for simulation)
2. Motion Detector (IoT hardware)
3. Webcam (for live feed capture)
4. Siren (alert/response device)
5. Home Gateway (DLC100) for network interconnection
6. Tablet PC (for notification demonstration)
7. (Optional) TinkerCad/Fritzing for alternate simulation environments


Procedure:
1 Open Cisco Packet Tracer.
2 Add Home Gateway, Motion Detector, Siren, Webcam, and Tablet PC.
3 Connect devices wirelessly to the Home Gateway.
4 Configure Motion Detector to detect movement.
5 Set Siren to activate on motion detection.
6 Configure Tablet PC to receive alerts.
7 Run simulation and test motion detection and alerts.
8 Verify all devices respond correctly.
